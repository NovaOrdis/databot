os-stats  is a low-overhead monitoring program  designed  to run in the background,  indefinitely.
Only one os-stats instance per VM is necessary.   os-stats reads  O/S level metrics in a loop  and
writes them in a CSV file. If an os-stats process is already running in the background, an attempt
to start another os-stats instance will fail. The program reads its configuration from the default
location $OS_STATS_CONFIG_DIR/os-stats.conf or, if configured at startup with -c|--configuration=,
from  the  file  specified  by  the configuration option.  If no  OS_STATS_CONFIG_DIR  environment
variable is declared  and no configuration file is specified  at startup with -c|--configuration=,
the program will fail to start.  More details  on the syntax  of configuration file  are available
under the "Configuration" section.

To start an instance that runs in foreground, use --foreground command line option.  In foreground
mode, the output is switched automatically from the configured file destination to /dev/stdout and
the output.file configuration, as described below, is ignored.

os-stats  attempts  to use the java installation  indicated by  the OS_STATS_JAVA_HOME environment
variable,  is set.   If the OS_STATS_JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set,  os-stats uses the
standard way of locating java (JAVA_HOME, PATH, etc.)

os-stats  can  also  be  used  as a command line  manager  of  the os-stats process running in the
background. The commands that can be used are:

  help - display this content and exits.

  version - display the version and exit.

  status -  display whether a background os-stats process already runs on the system. If a process
    is found running, the command provides more information about it (such as the PID).

  stop - stop the background os-stats process, if running.

Command line options:

  --foreground, -fg -  run the command in foreground and  automatically switch the output from the
    configured file destination to /dev/stdout.


Configuration:

  sampling.interval -  sampling interval, in seconds. If not specified, the default is 10 seconds.

  output.file - the name of the output file. If not specified, the default value is
    /tmp/os-stats.csv.  Note that if --foreground option is used, the output will forcibly send to
    /dev/stdout, regardless of the value of 'output.file' configuration parameter.

  output.file.append  -  true/false. Indicates whether to append to an already existing file or to
    overwrite the file. The default value is "true" (append).

  metrics  -  the comma-separated list of the definitions for the metrics to be collected from the
    system. Example:

    metrics=PhysicalMemoryTotal,PhysicalMemoryUsed,SwapTotal,SwapUsed,CpuKernelTime,CpuUserTime

    For a complete list of supported metrics, run:

      os-stats --help metrics (not yet implemented, TODO).
