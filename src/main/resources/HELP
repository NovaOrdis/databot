os-stats  is a low-overhead monitoring program  designed  to run in the background,  indefinitely.
Only one os-stats instance per VM is necessary.   os-stats reads  O/S level metrics in a loop  and
writes them in a CSV file. If an os-stats process is already running in the background, an attempt
to start another os-stats instance will fail. The program reads its configuration from the default
location $OS_STATS_CONFIG_DIR/os-stats.conf or, if configured at startup with -c|--configuration=,
from the file specified by the configuration option.  More details  on the syntax of configuration
file are available under the "Configuration" section.

To start an instance that runs in foreground, use --foreground command line option.  In foreground
mode,  the output is switched automatically to  /dev/stdout and the output.file configuration,  as
described below, is ignored.

os-stats  can  also  be  used  as a command line  manager  of  the os-stats process running in the
background. The commands that can be used are:

  help - display this content and exits.

  version - display the version and exit.

  status -  display whether a background os-stats process already runs on the system. If a process
    is found running, the command provides more information about it (such as the PID).

  stop - stop the background os-stats process, if running.

Configuration ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  sampling.interval -  sampling interval, in seconds. If not specified, the default is 10 seconds.

  output.file - the name of the output file. If not specified, the default value is
    /tmp/os-stats.csv.  Note that if --foreground option is used, the output will forcibly send to
    /dev/stdout, regardless of the value of 'output.file' configuration parameter.
