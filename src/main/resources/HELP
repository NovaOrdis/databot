os-stats is a program designed to run in the background,  with a low-overhead.   Only one instance
per VM is necessary.  os-stats reads O/S level metrics  in a loop  and writes them in a  CSV file.
If an os-stats process is already running in the background,  an attempt to start another os-stats
process will fail.  The program reads its configuration from $OS_STATS_HOME/etc/os-stats.conf, or,
if configured at startup with  -c|--configuration=,  from the file specified  by the configuration
option.  More details on the syntax of configuration file are available under the  "Configuration"
section.

os-stats  can  also  be  used  as a command line  manager  of  the os-stats process running in the
background. The commands that can be used are:

  help - display this content and exits.

  version - display the version and exit.

  status -  display whether a background os-stats process already runs on the system, and provides
    more information about it (such as the PID), if the process is found running.

  stop - stop the background os-stats process, if running.
